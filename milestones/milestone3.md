## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The project has been progressing steadily. We've made solid strides by discussing and clarifying some key features, which gave us a clearer vision of the end product. This initial alignment allowed us to start the development process with a clear roadmap, propelling the project further to production.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Overall, we did not encounter many challenges thus far. We are progressing forward with this project steadily. And we are analyzing the requirements carefully to ensure that we will complete each task according to the rubric. And we are diligent to ensure that each milestone was met on time.

### 3. Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We've successfully completed all the tasks outlined in our sprint plan for the week. This allows us to stay on track with our project goals. This accomplishment reflects our team’s efficient time management and clear vision of the project roadmap, which helped us tackle each item systematically.

### 4. Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We’re currently uncertain if adding a flag and review monitoring system aligns with the scope of this project. Hence, these will be the features to be put in the "at risk" category. If they remain at risk due to time or scope constraints, we’ll focus on core functionalities first to ensure that essential user stories are fully implemented.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As we continue with implementation phase, we might need support in accurately estimating the time required for each task to meet the project requirements/rubric. It's crucial to identify when a feature is taking more time than anticipated, so we can prioritize the core requirements before tackling additional, secondary features. This approach will help us stay on track with the rubric’s expectations and ensure we’re meeting essential milestones on time.
