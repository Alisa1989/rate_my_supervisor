## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to progress further along into this project. We've implemented the functionalities to see the reviews for both the supervisors and the organizations. Also, developed functionalities to add reviews for supervisors and organizations. We are happy with our progress so far with the majority of the functionalities done for this web app.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

No issues or challenges thus far. We are progressing forward with this project steadily. And we are analyzing the requirements carefully to ensure that we will complete each task according to the rubric. And we are diligent to ensure that each milestone was met on time.

### 3. Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We did complete all the tasks outlined in our sprint plan for the week. The core functionalities of this web app are done. This allows us to stay on track with our project goals. We will continue to be diligent with our next sprint to complete the remaining functionalities and refine the app as necessary.

### 4. Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We are currently not sure if adding a flag and review monitoring system aligns with the scope of this project. Hence, these will be the features to be put in the "at risk" category. If these features remain at risk due to time or scope constraints, we’ll focus on the remaining core functionalities first to ensure that essential user stories are fully implemented.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As we proceed further along into implementation phase, we might need support in accurately estimating the time required for each task to meet the project requirements/rubric. Being able to identify when a feature is taking more time than anticipated, we can prioritize the core requirements before tackling additional, secondary features. This approach will help us stay on track with the rubric’s expectations and ensure we meet essential milestones on time.
