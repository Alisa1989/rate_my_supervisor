## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The project has been progressing well, with additional milestones achieved. We were able to brainstorm the app's layout and functionality, refining our vision through wireframes to visually guide the design/frontend. Moreover, we established a clearer understanding of the data structure, mapping out how tables will interact through an entity relationship diagram. And our team has been communicating well which helps the development stages to move forward smoothly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Overall, we did not encounter many challenges thus far. We are progressing forward with this project steadily. And we are analyzing the requirements carefully to ensure that we will complete each task according to the rubric. And we are diligent to ensure that each milestone was met on time.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As we move into the implementation phase, we might need support in accurately estimating the time required for each task to meet the project requirements/rubric. It will be important to identify when a feature is taking more time than anticipated, so we can prioritize the core requirements before tackling additional, secondary features. This approach will help us stay on track with the rubric’s expectations and ensure we’re meeting essential milestones on time.
